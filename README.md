## Project Overview

This repository contains the complete stack for the Elettra smart boat telemetry and monitoring system. The project integrates embedded firmware (ESP32-S3), real-time sensor acquisition (temperature, GPS), SD card logging, MQTT communication over Ethernet, and a cross-platform desktop application (Electron + React) for live dashboards, historical data, map tracking, and event logs.

**What this project does:**
- Collects temperature and GPS data from sensors on an ESP32-S3 microcontroller.
- Logs all sensor data to an SD card for redundancy and offline analysis.
- Publishes real-time sensor data via MQTT over Ethernet.
- Provides a desktop application to visualize live data, historical trends, and boat position on a map.
- Logs system and communication events for diagnostics.
- Optionally forwards data to a Grafana backend for advanced analytics.
